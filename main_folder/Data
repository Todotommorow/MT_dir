  "description": "'The Planet of Squirming Insects' is another name for the arid planet Lilythea. In its wastelands dominated by the ecosystem called 'insects' Primabella, a 'bee,' saves Lamritta, an 'ant,' who is attacked by worms. Lamritta calls her savior 'onee-sama,' and the girls gradually become closer. But the history of an endless war between 'the bees' and 'the ants' drives a great wedge between them.",
